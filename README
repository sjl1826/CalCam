CalCam is an iOS Application that uses Google Vision and Natural Language Processing to parse images of event flyers
and add such events to your Apple calendar. Through different calls made to the built-in iPhone camera to changing the image
to a base 64 file, we were able to analyze the data and create Event Objects through iOS SDK's EventKit to add these events
to the calendar.
